#+TITLE: Odin Members Only

Implementation of The Odin Project Members Only project - message board with users and members functionality and database support

* Used resources
- Minimalistic [[https://uchu.style/][uchu.style]] color palette

* Usage
- Note: PostgreSQL setup is required with database created
- Clone the project and ~cd~ into it
- Run ~npm install~
- Create ~.env~ file with the following data:
  - ~PORT~ - Port where you want to have the message board running (~3000~ by default)
  - ~DB_HOST~ - Hostname of the database server
  - ~DB_USER~ - PostgreSQL user
  - ~DB_DATABASE_NAME~ - Name of the database
  - ~DB_PORT~ - Port where PosgreSQL is running on the host
  - ~MEMBER_SECRET~ - Secret phrase/password to become a member on the message board
  - (Optional) ~MEMBER_SECRET_HINT~ - Can be used to help (or not) user to find secret key
  - ~ADMIN_FULLNAME~ - Desired fullname that will be visible on the board
  - ~ADMIN_USERNAME~ - Desired username to use on the board
  - ~ADMIN_PASSWORD~ - Admin's password 
- Run ~node db/populatedb.js~, this will create database scheme and admin user (credentials from ~.env~ for admin will be used only on this step)
- Run ~node app.js~ and the app will be accessible on the port that you provided during configuration
  
* Additional ideas
- [ ] Admin dashboard
  - [ ] User management (roles changing, deletion)
  - [ ] Secret change
